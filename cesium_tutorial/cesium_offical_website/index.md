# Build CesiumJS apps

- [CesiumJS API](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs/ref-doc/)
- Create entities
  - things about Primitive API and Entity API:

    CesiumJS has a rich API for spatial data that can be split into two categories:

    &emsp;a low-level **Primitive API** geared towards graphics developers,<br/>
    &emsp;and a high-level **Entity API** for data-driven visualization.

    The low-level Primitive API exposes the minimal amount of abstraction needed to perform the task at hand. It is structured to provide a flexible implementation for graphics developers, not for API consistency.

    The Entity API exposes a set of consistently designed high-level objects that aggregate related visualization and information into a unified data structure, which we call an Entity.
